code-snippets
=============

This is my collection of example codes and other useful codes which I came across on my programming journey.  Feel free to use these codes and I will be glad if you want to contribute new codes or improve existing ones.

I usually save most of my code snippets to my Evernote but I am now trying to commit them here and link to Evernote.

I usually save or commit only if I feel its working but still I can't guarantee you. Use at your own risk and let me know if something goes wrong.
